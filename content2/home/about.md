# Biography

Chin-Jung Hsu is a Computer Science Ph.D candidate at North Carolina State University.  His general research interests are cloud computing and big data, and current research direction is Hadoop optimization for decoupled storage architecture.  In 2009, I received M.S. in Computer Science from National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan.  After graduated, I worked as a research assistant in the same university, and as an engineer on Android Framework at Acer Inc.  Then, I decided to pursue a Ph.D for exploring top-notch knowledge in distributed systems.  Last summer, I was an intern at NetApp to research how to adapt machine learning and data mining techniques to understand the behavior of complex systems.
