# Biography

I am a Ph.D. student, advised by [Dr. Vincent W. Freeh](https://freeh.wordpress.ncsu.edu/), of [Computer Science](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/) at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/),   My research primarily focuses on optimizing system performance of large-scale distributed systems.  Due to the growing complexity of systems, I am passionate about applying machine learning techniques to address problems in systems such as cloud computing and software-defined storage.

Before starting my Ph.D., I received M.S. in [Computer Science](http://isa.web.nthu.edu.tw/bin/home.php?Lang=en) from [National Tsing Hua University](http://www.nthu.edu.tw/) in Taiwan.  After graduation, I was an Android engineer at [Acer Inc.](http://www.acer.com) In 2011, I started my journey in the states.  I was a performance measurement intern and a research intern in [NetApp](http://www.netapp.com) for the summer of 2013 and 2014, and in 2015, I interned at [AT&T Labs Research](http://www.research.att.com), working on [software-defined storage](http://about.att.com/innovation/labs/software_defined_storage).
