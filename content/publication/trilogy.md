abstract = "Infrastructure as a Service, one of the most disrup- tive aspects of cloud computing, enables configuring a cluster for each application for each workload. When the workload changes, a cluster will be either underutilized (wasting resources) or unable to meet demand (incurring opportunity costs). Conse- quently, efficient cluster resizing requires proper data replication and placement. Our work reveals that coarse-grain, workload- aware replication addresses over-utilization but cannot resolve under-utilization. With fine-grain partitioning of the dataset, data replication can reduce both under- and over-utilization. In our empirical studies, compared to a na Ìˆive uniform data replication a coarse-grain workload-aware replication increases throughput by 81% on a highly-skewed workload. A fine-grain scheme further reaches 166% increase. Furthermore, a surprisingly small increase in granularity is sufficient to obtain most benefits. Evalu- ations also show that maximizing the number of unique partitions per node increases robustness to tolerate workload deviation while minimizing this number reduces storage footprint."

abstract_short = "Data placement is crititcal to performance of cloud computing.  This work examines partition granularity, replication factors and placement strategies.  Our work concludes that the fine-grain, balanced data placement improves systems performance and is more robust to (slightly) workload changes."
